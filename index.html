Great ideas happen when we come together
We worked with artists to create unique works of art that visualize collaboration and the great ideas that happen when we build something together. We’re calling it The Canvas Project.
And should your collaborators be halfway around the world, you can now pick one of these artworks to set the backdrop for your next get-together over Hangouts Meet.
Meet the artists
Influenced by the power of collaboration and connection these artists created both photographic and illustrative wallpapers for the Meet experience.
We’ll be collaborating with more artists, so check back for new artworks.
